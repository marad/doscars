Dos Cars
========

When I was young I used to play with Game Maker a lot. One of the results was
the game which I named `Dos Cars`. My siblings and I used to play this A LOT.
It was very simple yet very fun.

I wanted to remake this game for quite some time now and I must admit that this is not
the first try... I hope it will be the successful one!

##  Running this game

To run this game you only need to clone the repository and invoke `sbt run` command.
All should work out of the box. (I feel the urge to mention that SHOULD is the keyword here).
